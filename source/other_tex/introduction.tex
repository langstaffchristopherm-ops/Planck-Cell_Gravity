\section*{Introduction}

\emph{Planck--Cell Gravity} extends the S/t postulates into dynamics, treating
gravity as a drift field of the local entropy--time rate $\chi = S/t$.
With $g = -\nabla\Phi$ and $\Phi = \zeta\,\chi$, the flux law
$\nabla^2\Phi = 4\pi G\rho$ emerges without geometric input.  The same stiffness
$\omega_0$ that defines inertial resistance also sources the local drift,
enforcing $m_{\mathrm{inertial}} = m_{\mathrm{grav}}$ by construction.  This
approach recovers Newton's inverse--square law, gravitational redshift, and the
equivalence principle as immediate consequences of the tick substrate, framing
gravity as collective drift rather than applied force.
